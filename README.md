## Examples
- [Crossing Road](https://github.com/knavels/sveltekit-phaser-crossing-road-game)
- [Virtual Pet](https://github.com/knavels/phaser-sveltekit-virtual-pet-game)
- [Mario Style Game](https://github.com/knavels/sveltekit-phaser-mario-style-game)
- [RPG Example](https://github.com/knavels/sveltekit-phaser-rpg-framework)

**⚠️ Note:** This is stil more of a try and error to be able to experiment which way works best, so fill free to use, forke and share your thoughts with me. as an example in Virtual Pet, I tried to move all the UI to svelte, it works, it's ok but still I don't know why I would want to do that, instead in Mario and RPG I have used sveltekit as the data layer and I think that works for me.

**🙏 Note:** by the way all the examples are based on [Zenva courses](https://academy.zenva.com/product/html5-game-phaser-mini-degree/).

## Creating a project

Just use github to create new repo from this template or clone it.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
